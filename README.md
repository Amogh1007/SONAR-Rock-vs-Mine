# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine
It is a prediction model which helps in finding the underwater object is either <i>rock or mine</i> through SONAR sent by Submarines
<br>This model makes use of Logistic Regression for predicting and it got an accuracy score above 72% </br>
<br>The model is further in more training to increase its accuracy to much more significant numbers and I am trying to increase its accuracy more and even open for more ideas and changes</br>
